                                          SANTANDER-CUSTOMER-TRANSACTION-PREDICTION

In this project, we need to identify which customers will make a specific transaction in the future, irrespective of the amount of money transacted. Number of attributes: You are provided with an anonymized dataset containing numeric feature variables, the binary target column, and a string ID_code column. The task is to predict the value of target column in the test set.

It is a classification Problem.
